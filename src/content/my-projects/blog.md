This is my custom build blog website. It doesn't have any normal content yet, because I am still working on its desing. It was created when I was learning Hugo static site generator and Netlify CMS (which it doesn't use anymore). It's build with plain html, css, javascript and using some of the Hugo magic to put everything together.
